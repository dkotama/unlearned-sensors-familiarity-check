## General Description

The Stevens Hydra Probe is a sophisticated soil moisture and temperature measurement sensor designed for environmental and agricultural monitoring applications. It provides comprehensive subsurface moisture and temperature data with high precision and reliability.

## Theory of Operation / Sensing Principle

The Hydra Probe utilizes advanced dielectric measurement technology to simultaneously determine:
- Volumetric Water Content (VWC)
- Soil Temperature
- Electrical Conductivity (EC)

The sensor employs capacitive and electromagnetic sensing principles to measure soil dielectric properties, which are directly correlated with moisture content.

## Features

- Simultaneous measurement of multiple soil parameters
- High accuracy soil moisture detection
- Integrated temperature sensing
- Robust stainless steel or titanium construction
- Low power consumption
- Wide measurement range
- Minimal soil disturbance during installation

## Potential Applications

- Precision agriculture
