# Step-by-Step Guide to Integrating Google Gemini API Using Python

This guide provides a detailed, step-by-step process for integrating the Google Gemini API into a Python application, focusing on prototyping with the Google AI Python SDK. The instructions are based on current documentation as of May 3, 2025, and are designed for developers building applications with text generation or multimodal capabilities.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:
- A Google account to access Google AI Studio.
- Python 3.7 or higher installed.
- `pip` for installing Python packages.
- Basic knowledge of Python and API usage.

## Step 1: Obtain a Gemini API Key
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Click **Create API Key** and copy the generated key.
4. Store the API key securely (e.g., in an environment variable or a `.env` file) to avoid exposing it in your code.

**Note**: Do not hardcode the API key in your application for security reasons. Use environment variables or a configuration file.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Python Environment
1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it:
   ```bash
   mkdir gemini-api-project
   cd gemini-api-project
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the Google AI Python SDK:
   ```bash
   pip install google-generativeai
   ```

## Step 3: Configure the API Key
1. Install the `python-dotenv` package to manage environment variables:
   ```bash
   pip install python-dotenv
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file in your project directory and add your API key:
   ```plaintext
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Create a Python script (e.g., `gemini_example.py`) and load the API key:
   ```python
   import os
   from dotenv import load_dotenv

   load_dotenv()
   api_key = os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
   ```

## Step 4: Initialize the Gemini API Client
1. In your Python script, import the Google AI SDK and configure it with your API key:
   ```python
   import google.generativeai as genai

   genai.configure(api_key=api_key)
   ```
2. Select a Gemini model (e.g., `gemini-1.5-pro` for multimodal capabilities):
   ```python
   model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-pro")
   ```

**Note**: Check available models in the documentation at [Google AI Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini) to ensure you select the appropriate one for your use case.

## Step 5: Generate Text Content
1. Use the model to generate text by sending a prompt:
   ```python
   prompt = "Write a short story about a robot learning to paint."
   response = model.generate_content(prompt)
   print(response.text)
   ```
2. Run the script to test the API:
   ```bash
   python gemini_example.py
   ```
3. The API will return a generated story, which you can display or process further.

## Step 6: Implement Multimodal Prompting (Optional)
1. To use multimodal capabilities (e.g., text + image), ensure you have an image file (e.g., `image.jpg`) in your project directory.
2. Modify your script to include an image in the prompt:
   ```python
   from PIL import Image

   # Load an image
   image = Image.open("image.jpg")

   # Create a multimodal prompt
   prompt = ["Describe the scene in this image:", image]
   response = model.generate_content(prompt)
   print(response.text)
   ```
3. Run the script again to see the API describe the image.

**Note**: Ensure the image meets the requirements (e.g., supported formats like JPEG or PNG) as specified at [Vision Prompting](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/vision#prompting-images).

## Step 7: Handle Errors and Rate Limits
1. Add error handling to manage API issues like rate limits or invalid requests:
   ```python
   try:
       response = model.generate_content(prompt)
       print(response.text)
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
   ```
2. Check the API response for issues like content filtering or incomplete results:
   ```python
   if response.candidates:
       print(response.candidates[0].content)
   else:
       print("No valid response received.")
   ```

## Step 8: Prepare for Production (Optional)
1. For prototyping, the Google AI Python SDK is sufficient, but for production, consider migrating to Vertex AI for enhanced security and scalability.
2. Follow the migration guide at [Vertex AI Migration](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/migrate/migrate-google-ai#google-ai) to update your code.
3. Use Google Cloud’s Vertex AI with authentication via service accounts instead of API keys, as detailed at [Vertex AI Setup](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/setup).

## Step 9: Test and Iterate
1. Test your application with various prompts to ensure the API behaves as expected.
2. Explore the [Google Gemini Cookbook](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook) for advanced examples, such as function calling or code execution.
3. Use Google AI Studio to experiment with prompts before coding them, as suggested at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

## Step 10: Secure Your Application
1. Restrict your API key to specific APIs and IP addresses in the Google Cloud Console to prevent unauthorized use, as advised at [API Key Security](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key#security).
2. Avoid exposing the API key in client-side code or public repositories.
3. For production, use server-side calls or Vertex AI to minimize key exposure risks.

## Example Script
Below is the complete Python script combining the above steps for a text and multimodal example:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import google.generativeai as genai
from PIL import Image

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()
api_key = os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")

# Configure the Gemini API
genai.configure(api_key=api_key)
model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-pro")

# Generate text
try:
    text_prompt = "Write a short story about a robot learning to paint."
    text_response = model.generate_content(text_prompt)
    print("Text Response:")
    print(text_response.text)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Text generation error: {e}")

# Generate multimodal response (text + image)
try:
    image = Image.open("image.jpg")
    multimodal_prompt = ["Describe the scene in this image:", image]
    multimodal_response = model.generate_content(multimodal_prompt)
    print("\nMultimodal Response:")
    print(multimodal_response.text)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Multimodal generation error: {e}")
```
