## General Description

The Crop Circle ACS-211 is an active crop canopy sensor that calculates the NDVI vegetation index and measures reflectance from plant canopies and soil.  Unlike passive radiometric light sensors, the ACS-211 is not limited by ambient lighting conditions, enabling measurements day or night.  It is designed for on-the-go applications, mounting on vehicles to sense/map crop biomass, and is also adaptable for pole-mounted and handheld use. [Page 1]

## Theory of Operation / Sensing Principle

The ACS-211 incorporates two optical measurement channels. It simultaneously measures crop/soil reflectance at 670 nm and 780 nm.  A unique feature is its ability to make 3D NDVI measurements by assessing the approximate height of the plant canopy, which is then used to scale the NDVI measurement. [Page 1]
