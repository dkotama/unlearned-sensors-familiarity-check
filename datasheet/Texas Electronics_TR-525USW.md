## General Description

The TR-525USW is a remote tipping bucket-style rain gauge with an 8-inch diameter collector funnel. It is designed to measure liquid precipitation accurately and meets National Weather Service requirements. Rain enters through the top, fills a calibrated tipping bucket mechanism, and triggers a switch with each tip to increment precipitation totals. The system is self-emptying and operates without requiring manual water removal.

## Theory of Operation / Sensing Principle

Rainfall is collected through the 8" funnel and directed into a mechanical tipping bucket. As each calibrated volume fills the bucket, it tips and triggers a switch closure. This momentary contact is interpreted as a rainfall event by connected data acquisition systems. Each tip represents a fixed volume (e.g., 0.2 mm) of precipitation.
