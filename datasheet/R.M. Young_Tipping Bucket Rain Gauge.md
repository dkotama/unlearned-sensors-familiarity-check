## General Description

The R.M. Young Model 52202 / 52203 Tipping Bucket Rain Gauge is designed for high-performance precipitation measurement and meets World Meteorological Organization (WMO) specifications. It features molded thermoplastic components for corrosion resistance. Model 52202 is equipped with a heating element for year-round operation, while Model 52203 is suitable for temperate climates.

## Theory of Operation / Sensing Principle

The gauge collects rain through a funnel that channels it into a tipping bucket mechanism. As each side of the bucket fills and tips, it actuates a magnetic reed switch to generate a signal pulse. The count of these pulses represents cumulative rainfall. Calibration ensures a specific amount of rain per bucket tip.
