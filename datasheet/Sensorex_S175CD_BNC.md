## General Description

The S175CD/BNC is a rugged combination spear-tip pH electrode designed for direct insertion into semi-solid samples such as meat, cheese, and soil. It features a spear-shaped durable glass sensing element housed in a virtually unbreakable Ultem® body. The sealed, double junction reference and gel-filled electrolyte minimize contamination and extend electrode life, especially in samples containing silver ions.

## Theory of Operation / Sensing Principle

The electrode operates using the glass membrane pH sensing principle, where the pH-sensitive spear-shaped glass bulb interacts with hydrogen ions in a sample to produce a millivolt signal. This potential difference is referenced against an internal Ag/AgCl reference electrode, with the signal transmitted via a BNC connector. A double junction reference design isolates the reference system from sample contamination.
