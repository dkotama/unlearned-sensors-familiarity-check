## Potential Applications

The document does not explicitly list applications, but the sensor is designed for soil moisture measurement, which is relevant to various fields including:

* Agriculture
* Environmental science
* Hydrology
* Ecology

## Pin Configuration and Description

The manual provides wiring diagrams for connecting the EC-5 sensor. The sensor is equipped with a 3.5 mm stereo plug, and wiring information is provided for connecting to both Decagon and non-Decagon data loggers. [Page 5]

## Absolute Maximum Ratings

The document does not provide a section on absolute maximum ratings.

## Electrical Characteristics

* **Power Requirements:** 2.5VDC - 3.6VDC @ 10mA [Page 1]
* **Output:** 10-40% of excitation voltage (250-1000mV at 2500mV excitation) [Page 1]

## Operating Conditions

* **Operating Environment:** -40 to +60°C [Page 1]

## Sensor Performance / Specifications

* **Accuracy:**
    * ±0.03 m³/m³ in all soils, up to 8 dS/m [Page 1]
    * ±0.02 m³/m³ with soil-specific calibration [Page 1]
* **Resolution:** 0.001 m³/m³ VWC in mineral soils, 0.25% in growing media [Page 1]
* **Measurement Time:** 10 ms [Page 1]
* **Range of Measurement: 0 to saturation** [Page 1]

## Communication Protocol / Interface

* Analog voltage output.

## Register Map

The document does not provide a register map, as the sensor provides an analog voltage output.

## Package Information / Mechanical Dimensions

* Sensor dimensions: 8.9cm x 1.8cm x 0.7cm [Page 1]
* Cable length: 5m standard, custom lengths or extension cables are available [Page 1]
* Connector types: 3.5 mm plug or stripped and tinned lead wires [Page 1]

## Basic Usage / Application Information

The EC-5 sensor is inserted into the soil, and its analog voltage output is read by a data logger. The data logger is then used to convert the voltage signal to volumetric water content.

## Compliance and Certifications

* **Declaration of Conformity:** The EC-5 ECH2O soil moisture sensor meets the standards for CE compliance. [Page 17, 18]
