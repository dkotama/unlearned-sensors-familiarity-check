## General Description

The Trimble® GreenSeeker Handheld Crop Sensor is a low-cost, easy-to-use optical measurement device used to assess crop health and vigor for nutrient management. The sensor provides real-time NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) readings, enabling users to make informed decisions about fertilizer application. It is ideal for use in-field with Bluetooth connectivity for seamless data capture.

## Theory of Operation / Sensing Principle

The GreenSeeker measures the reflectance of two specific light wavelengths—red (660 nm) and near-infrared (780 nm)—to calculate NDVI. The sensor emits light and measures reflected energy from crops at a set height. NDVI values are computed using the formula:

**NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)**

This calculation provides an objective indicator of crop vigor.
