# Cordulus Tipping Bucket Rain Gauge

This document provides an overview of the Cordulus Tipping Bucket Rain Gauge, based on the information in the provided PDF datasheet.

## Manufacturer Info

* **Manufacturer:** Casella CEL
* **Model Name/Number:** TBRG (Tipping Bucket Rain Gauge)
* **Website:** www.casellameasurement.com

## General Description

The Casella TBRG is a robust transducer designed for use as a standalone sensor with a separate data logging system. It's used to measure rainfall. The rain gauge is constructed from aluminium alloy and has a machined septum ring at the top, forming a 400 cm² aperture.  The tipping bucket mechanism is mounted on an aluminium-alloy base with a built-in spirit level for easy and accurate installation. [Page 1]

## Theory of Operation / Sensing Principle

The rain gauge uses a tipping bucket mechanism.  Rainwater is collected in a bucket, and when the bucket fills to a certain level, it tips.  The tipping action causes a contact closure. The number of tips is counted by a data logger, with each tip corresponding to a specific amount of rainfall. [Page 2]

## Features

* Reliable and robust design [Page 1]
* Designed as a stand-alone sensor for use with an existing logging system. [Page 1]
* Body and funnel made from aluminium alloy [Page 1]
* Machined septum ring with a 400 cm² aperture [Page 1]
* Tipping bucket mechanism mounted on a cast aluminium-alloy base [Page 1, 2]
* Built-in spirit level for easy and accurate positioning [Page 1, 2]
* Lightweight, injection-molded plastic tipping bucket [Page 2]

## Absolute Maximum Ratings

The document does not provide absolute maximum ratings.

## Electrical Characteristics

* **Output:** Contact closure [Page 2]
* **Transducer:** Magnet/Reed switch [Page 2]

## Operating Conditions

* **Operating Temperature Range:** 1°C to 85°C [Page 2]

## Sensor Performance / Specifications

* **Bucket Sizes:** 0.1 mm, 0.2 mm, or 0.5 mm (amount of rain per tip) [Page 2]
* **Aperture:** 400 cm² [Page 2]
* **Accuracy:** ±2% at 1 liter/hour rainfall rate [Page 2]
* **Capacity:** Unlimited [Page 2]

## Communication Protocol / Interface

* The rain gauge provides a contact closure output, typically connected to a data logger. [Page 2]

## Register Map

The device does not have a register map, as it provides a simple contact closure output.

## Package Information / Mechanical Dimensions

* The document provides some mechanical information:
    * The base and septum ring are cast in Aluminium Alloy LM25. [Page 2]
    * The outer ring and funnel are fabricated from aluminium alloy sheet. [Page 2]
    * **Weight:** 2.6 kg [Page 2]
* Detailed mechanical dimensions are not provided in this document.

## Basic Usage / Application Information

The Tipping Bucket Rain Gauge is designed to be used with a separate data logging system.  The rain gauge is mounted in an appropriate location, and the output is connected to the data logger, which records the number of tips over time. [Page 1, 2]
