# Davis Instruments Wind Speed Sensor S-WCF-M003 Information

This document provides an overview of the Davis Instruments Wind Speed and Direction Smart Sensor (S-WCF-M003), based on information from the provided PDF manual. The sensor is designed to work with HOBO data loggers. [Page 1]

## Manufacturer Info

* **Manufacturer:** Davis Instruments (modified for Onset HOBO loggers) [Page 1, 13]
* **Model Name/Number:** S-WCF-M003 [Page 1]

## General Description

The Davis Instruments S-WCF-M003 is a smart sensor that measures wind speed and direction. It is designed to be easily added to HOBO stations using a plug-in modular connector. All sensor parameters are stored within the smart sensor, simplifying setup and configuration. [Page 1]

## Theory of Operation / Sensing Principle

* **Wind Speed:** Cup revolutions are accumulated every three seconds, and the average speed is calculated for the logging interval. [Page 1]
* **Wind Direction:** Unit vector averaging is used; vector components are calculated every three seconds. [Page 1]

## Features

* Designed to work with HOBO stations. [Page 1]
* Plug-in modular connector for easy installation. [Page 1]
* Sensor parameters are stored internally. [Page 1]
* Automatic communication of configuration information to the logger. [Page 1]
* No programming required. [Page 1]
* Measures wind speed and gust speed.
* Measures wind direction.
* Weatherproof housing. [Page 1]
* UV-resistant materials. [Page 1]
* Sealed stainless steel bearings. [Page 1]

## Potential Applications

* Wind monitoring with HOBO data loggers. [Page 1]

## Pin Configuration and Description

The document does not provide a detailed pin configuration, as the sensor is designed to connect to HOBO stations via a smart sensor network cable.

## Absolute Maximum Ratings

The document does not provide consolidated information on absolute maximum ratings.
