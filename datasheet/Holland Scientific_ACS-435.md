## General Description

The Crop Circle ACS-435 is an active crop canopy sensor designed to measure vegetation indices and reflectance data from plant canopies and soil. Unlike passive sensors, it operates independently of ambient lighting, allowing measurements both day and night. It is suitable for vehicle, pole-mounted, or handheld applications and provides insight into biomass, nutrients, water, disease, and other growing conditions.

## Theory of Operation / Sensing Principle

The ACS-435 uses a modulated polychromatic LED light source and a three-channel silicon photodiode array to actively illuminate and measure crop/soil reflectance at 670 nm, 730 nm, and 780 nm. Its unique technology allows for height-independent reflectance measurement, ensuring accuracy regardless of distance from the target within the specified range.
