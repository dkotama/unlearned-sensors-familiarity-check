I want you to act as an expert technical writer targeting professional engineers. 
Your task is to generate a comprehensive datasheet for a specific sensor, which I will provide below, based solely on your current knowledge base up to your last training cut-off. The output must be in Markdown (.md) format.

**Sensor:** {sensor_brand} {sensor_type}

Please structure the datasheet logically, including standard sections applicable to most sensors, such as:

*   **Disclaimer:** Start with a clear disclaimer stating that this datasheet is generated based on general knowledge up to your last training data cut-off, is not an official manufacturer document, and accuracy cannot be guaranteed. Advise that the official manufacturer datasheet should always be consulted for critical applications and final design decisions.
*   **Manufacturer Info** : Add important information about manufacturer and manufacturing info such as production date, website of manufacturer here.
*   **General Description:** Brief overview of the sensor's function and technology.
*   **Theory of Operation / Sensing Principle:** Explain the underlying mechanism of how the sensor works, if known.
*   **Features:** Key capabilities and selling points.
*   **Potential Applications:** Common use cases for this type of sensor.
*   **Pin Configuration and Description:** Pin names, numbers, and functions.
*   **Absolute Maximum Ratings:** Stress ratings beyond which damage may occur.
*   **Electrical Characteristics:** Detailed voltage levels, input/output characteristics, etc.
    *   Include a subsection for **Power Consumption Breakdown** detailing current draw in different operational modes (e.g., active/measurement, idle/sleep, communication active) if known.
*   **Operating Conditions:** Recommended supply voltage, environmental ranges like temperature, humidity if applicable.
*   **Sensor Performance / Specifications:** Detailing key metrics relevant to the sensor type (e.g., range, accuracy, resolution, sensitivity, response time, stability, etc.). Fill this based on the specific sensor requested.
*   **Communication Protocol / Interface:** Detailing the method used (e.g., I2C, SPI, Analog Voltage, Single-Wire, UART, etc.), including relevant timings or parameters if known.
*   **Register Map:** If the sensor typically uses register-based configuration/data access via protocols like I2C/SPI, detail the known registers, their addresses, functions, and bit fields.
*   **Package Information / Mechanical Dimensions:** Describe common package(s) and physical dimensions if known.
*   **Basic Usage / Application Information:** Describe a typical connection diagram, required external components, and provide pseudo-code or steps for initialization, configuration, and data reading.
*   **Compliance and Certifications:** Include a placeholder section mentioning common standards like RoHS, CE, FCC, noting that specific compliance should be verified with the manufacturer.

Ensure the information provided within each section is as detailed and accurate as your knowledge allows for the specified sensor. 
Use standard Markdown formatting (Without wrapping it in ```md ```), including for any tables.
