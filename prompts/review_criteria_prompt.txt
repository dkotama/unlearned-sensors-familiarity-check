You are an expert technical reviewer tasked with evaluating an LLM-generated sensor datasheet against the official manufacturer datasheet. Your job is to compare the "Generated Datasheet" against the "Official Datasheet" and score the generated version on accuracy, comprehensiveness, and usability.

For each of the following 16 criteria (P1-P16), provide:
1. A score on a 1-5 Likert scale (1 = Very Poor, 5 = Excellent)
2. A brief justification explaining your score

# Official Datasheet
{{official_datasheet}}

# Generated Datasheet
{{generated_datasheet}}

# Scoring Criteria

## P1. Disclaimer (Score 1-5)
Check if the LLM-generated datasheet includes a disclaimer stating its unofficial nature, the lack of guaranteed accuracy, and the necessity to refer to the official manufacturer datasheet for critical applications.

## P2. Manufacturer Info (Score 1-5)
Verify if the LLM includes accurate manufacturer information, including the company name, website, and production details.

## P3. General Description (Score 1-5)
Compare the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the sensor's function and technology description.

## P4. Theory of Operation / Sensing Principle (Score 1-5)
Assess the explanation of how the sensor works, focusing on accuracy and detail.

## P5. Features (Score 1-5)
Evaluate key capabilities and selling points, noting any missing or incorrect information.

## P6. Potential Applications (Score 1-5)
Review common use cases, checking for completeness and relevance.

## P7. Pin Configuration and Description (Score 1-5)
Check for correct pin names, numbers, and functions.

## P8. Absolute Maximum Ratings (Score 1-5)
Compare stress ratings, ensuring no misinformation on damage thresholds.

## P9. Electrical Characteristics (Score 1-5)
Rate the detail level and accuracy of voltage levels, input/output characteristics, and the inclusion of a Power Consumption Breakdown for different modes.

## P10. Operating Conditions (Score 1-5)
Ensure the datasheets match on recommended supply voltage, temperature, and humidity ranges.

## P11. Sensor Performance / Specifications (Score 1-5)
Analyze key metrics like range, accuracy, resolution, sensitivity, response time, stability, etc., for accuracy and completeness.

## P12. Communication Protocol / Interface (Score 1-5)
Verify the description of communication methods, timings, and parameters.

## P13. Register Map (Score 1-5)
If applicable, compare the detail and accuracy of register-based configuration information. If not applicable, mark as "N/A".

## P14. Package Information / Mechanical Dimensions (Score 1-5)
Check for correct package descriptions and dimensions.

## P15. Basic Usage / Application Information (Score 1-5)
Rate the usefulness of connection diagrams, external components, and steps for sensor setup.

## P16. Compliance and Certifications (Score 1-5)
Ensure placeholders for common standards are included, noting the need for manufacturer verification.

# Overall Score (1-5)
Finally, provide a single overall score on a 1-5 Likert scale (1 = Very Poor, 5 = Excellent) and an overall justification.

# Response Format
Return your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure (do not include any explanatory text outside the JSON):

```json
{
  "p1_score": 3,
  "p1_justification": "The generated datasheet includes a basic disclaimer...",
  "p2_score": 4,
  "p2_justification": "Manufacturer information is mostly accurate...",
  ...
  "p16_score": "N/A",
  "p16_justification": "Not applicable for this sensor type...",
  "overall_score": 4,
  "overall_justification": "The generated datasheet is generally accurate..."
}
```

Note:
- If criterion not exist you can score it 0, and write on the justification that the criterion not exist.
- Provide brief but specific justifications (2-3 sentences)
- Be fair and objective in your assessment
- The overall score should reflect your holistic judgment, not simply an average
