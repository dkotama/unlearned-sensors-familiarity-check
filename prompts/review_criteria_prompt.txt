You are an expert technical reviewer tasked with evaluating an LLM-generated sensor datasheet against the official manufacturer datasheet for the {{SENSOR_BRAND}} {{SENSOR_MODEL}}. Your job is to compare the "Generated Datasheet" against the "Official Datasheet" and score the generated version on accuracy, comprehensiveness, and usability.

# IMPORTANT: Focus only on the {{SENSOR_BRAND}} {{SENSOR_MODEL}} sensor
Do not reference, compare with, or mention any other sensor models in your review.
Only use,compare and review information from the provided Official Datasheet and Generated Datasheet,
You don't need to use your knowledge. This is important to avoid your hallucination.

For each of the following 16 criteria (P1-P16), provide:
1. A score on a 1-5 Likert scale (1 = Very Poor, 5 = Excellent)
2. A brief justification explaining your score for the {{SENSOR_BRAND}} {{SENSOR_MODEL}} only

## P16. Compliance and Certifications (Score 1-5)
Ensure placeholders for common standards are included for the {{SENSOR_BRAND}} {{SENSOR_MODEL}}, noting the need for manufacturer verification.

# Overall Score (1-5)
Finally, provide a single overall score on a 1-5 Likert scale (1 = Very Poor, 5 = Excellent) and an overall justification focused exclusively on the {{SENSOR_BRAND}} {{SENSOR_MODEL}} datasheet.

# Response Format
Return your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure (do not include any explanatory text outside the JSON):

```json
{
  "sensor_evaluated": "{{SENSOR_BRAND}} {{SENSOR_MODEL}}",
  "p1_score": 3,
  "p1_justification": "The generated datasheet includes a basic disclaimer...",
  "p2_score": 4,
  "p2_justification": "Manufacturer information is mostly accurate...",
  ...
  "p16_score": "N/A",
  "p16_justification": "Not applicable for this {{SENSOR_BRAND}} {{SENSOR_MODEL}} sensor...",
  "overall_score": 4,
  "overall_justification": "The generated datasheet is generally accurate...",
  "confirmation": "This review is exclusively for the {{SENSOR_BRAND}} {{SENSOR_MODEL}} sensor and contains no references to other sensor models."
}
```

Note:
- If criterion not exist you can score it 0, and write on the justification that the criterion not exist.
- Provide brief but specific justifications (2-3 sentences)
- Be fair and objective in your assessment
- The overall score should reflect your holistic judgment, not simply an average
